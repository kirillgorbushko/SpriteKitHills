# SpriteKitHills

SpriteKit example how to generate dynmically "Tiny Wings" style hills in SpriteKit/Swift 3.
The code is based on the article at:
http://www.raywenderlich.com/32954/how-to-create-a-game-like-tiny-wings-with-cocos2d-2-x-part-1

Many thanks for it.

Remark:
Frame rate is too low to use 1:1, so it just gives an idea.
I use in my project this code to dynamically create textures and use them.
